        In 2nd grade,

    I used to disappear after school, heading to the playground to play without telling my mom.
    <br>
    This made her worried since I wouldn't come home immediately after school,
    even though it was just a 10-minute walk.
    <br>
    She never knew where I was.
    <br>

    To keep me on her radar and occupied,
    my mom signed me up for an afterschool computer club.
    <br>
    In the club, we spent hours memorizing and practicing
    typing on the computer keyboard and played video games.

    Growing more interests in online games,
    <br>
    I started to make my own games using Microsoft PowerPoint.
    <br>
    Mainly using hyperlinks, I created many cute character tycoon games.
    <br>
    <br>
    <hr>
    I used Naver Blog, a service from the largest Korean
    search engine and online portal, 
    <br>
    to publish my own blogs and the games I made to the public.
    <br>
    <br>
    <hr>
    Looking back, the games I shared were obviously a bit strange
    because I was very young, only in second grade.
    <br>
    But thankfully, I got positive engagements, views, downloads, and comments.
    <br>
    From then on, I felt great and creative about using the web.
